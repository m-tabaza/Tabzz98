### Hi, I'm Muhammad

## What I Do
### Language Design & Implementation
In July 2019, I co-founded [Pragma](https://pragmalang.com/): a company dedicated to building great software development tools. We're primarily working on a new language for building GraphQL APIs through schema-driven development.

### Web Development
I mainly use React with TypeScript on the front-end, and purely functional Scala on the back-end.
