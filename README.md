## What I Do

<h3><p align="center">Product Engineering</p></h3>
<p align="center">
  In April 2021, I joined <a href="https://businesschat.io">BusinessChat</a> as a founding engineer, where I've been working on many areas of the product. Mainly, I've implemented the chat bot runtime, and large parts of the Whatsapp marketing engine.

<h3><p align="center">Programming Languages</p></h3>

  In July 2019, I co-created <a href="https://pragmalang.com/">Pragma</a>: a language for effortlessly creating elegant GraphQL APIs. More recently, I've been experimenting with purely functional visual programming language design.
