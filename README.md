### Hi, I'm Muhammad

## What I Do
### Language Design & Implementation
In July 2019, I co-founded [Pragma](https://pragmalang.com/): a company dedicated to building great software development tools. We're primarily working on a new language for building GraphQL APIs through schema-driven development.

### Web Development
In March 2018, I was hired as a Web developer at [CodeObia](http://codeobia.com/), Amman, where I practiced building full-stack web applications, mainly using JavaScript on both ends.

The most valuable experience I acquired while working at CodeObia was in building highly dynamic data visualizations, using  Angular and HighCharts. Check out [AReS: The Agricultural Research e-Seeker](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/explorer/).

Working at CodeObia also involved mobile application development using [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/), a JavaScript framework that can be used in addition to Angular to build native Android and iOS applications from the same code base. 

I left CodeObia in November 2018 to study more advanced areas of computer science and mathematics.
