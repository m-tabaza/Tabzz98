### Hi, I'm Muhammad

## What I Do

### Programming Languages
In July 2019, I co-created [Pragma](https://pragmalang.com/): a language for effortlessly creating elegant GraphQL APIs. More recently, I've been experimenting with purely functional visual programming language design.

### Product Engineering
In April 2021, I joined [BusinessChat](https://businesschat.io) as a founding engineer, where I've been working on many areas of the product. Mainly, I've implemented the chat bot runtime, and large parts of the Whatsapp marketing engine.
